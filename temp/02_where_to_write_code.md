## Where do I write my code?

Since some of you may not have installed an **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) on your computer yet, you may use an online version to write your code. For your Tutorial 0, [**Programiz**](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) is a good choice.

As we will start to learn how to work with multiple `.c` files in Tutorial 1 and your homework, please create a workspace on [**Github Codespace**](https://github.com/features/codespaces). The environment is similar to VSCode. However, we do not really recommend setting it up on your machine as it may be troublesome to install the C compiler (unless you already have it installed). Hence, we will use this for now.

For robotics programming, we will teach you to install [**CubeIDE**](https://www.st.com/content/st\_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html?dl=mDz41Ame3rsvInWnnBOgtQ%3D%3D%2CcZwAba%2BIy%2FG8DrU77U5EEghQuKOCpNSACfvi2bwE08ZENmt9WBEXUiTFvdmySC1TNkz3H0dEAD1mlAg7m066zK%2F%2FEiRsAU9fsh2Z8qjWUeqproTDa74wIxaZNYl1hc8eF0gQr7rlIcOFvgurma6ZSOcIVxYHcXIdvJ5AxC%2BjWa6UGFNZRkS7jDzol8Tpl0jvo%2FAMwRruaLwkCR%2FMlSU58%2BCO7kAgbbpI9k1Vk9wfiVIDHh0oLoPz8srvZAj96TsE29RwNdrqa5DDOqFkNATwOtfq6CcuEy9pRVfVZ3qne5KLKsG0slrZQbhGh4%2FQj8jZ6HR7SsRXbr3AoEgc4EqypbnffnzAqnjfo6JE9Ir0kfR1TifcvX1rsJBK9ih6p%2Fbw%2BnqV22OC7utWyvidL7rQyLfyuw2MzWI7bH8qtlwMkyfOYFJ2k%2Bdkhpuhbe5jf6GM\&uid=Pg30eCicqbj1AXYhNpUwb3QskPXfCpAM#get-software)**,** which is where you will spend the majority of your time during our tutorials.
