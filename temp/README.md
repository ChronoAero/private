During the revision period of the tutorial notes:
I actually made a live link to render the markdown, please check it out: [https://chronoaero.github.io/private/temp/README.html](https://chronoaero.github.io/private/temp/README.html)

There are some stashed question in [here](question_drafts.html), please see if any may can be our homework or self tests. 

The not-so-important-so-please-scroll-quickly Part:

* [01) Intro](01_intro.html)

Your first C program (~15 minutes)

* [02) Where to run your C code](02_where_to_write_code.html)
* [03) Hello World](03_hello_world)

Actual Materials

* [04) Variables and Input-Output](04_variable_io.html) (~30 
minutes)
  * Variables, assignment using `=`, `printf`, `scanf`
* [05) Operators](05_operators_html) (~30 minutes)
  * Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.), relational (`<`, `==`, etc.), compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`), increment and decrement (`++` and `--`)
* [06) Rules and Extra Features](06_rules_and_extra_features.html) (~10 minutes, should be quick)
  * Rules on variable naming, booleans, standard integers, casting, and `const` keyword
* [07) Control Flow](07_control_flow.html) (~1 hour)
  * `if` statements, `switch` statemtent, `while` statement, `for` statement, scope
* [08) Array and String](08_array_string.html) (~30 minutes)
  * arrays, string (array of `char`), and the library `string.h`
* [09) Struct](09_struct.html) (~15 minutes)
* [10) Functions](10_functions.html) (~20 minutes)
* [11) Recursion](11_recursion.html) (~40 minutes, we might not cover too much of it in class, but the concept is quite tricky, it is left for you to self learn in detail)
* [12) Multi File Programming](12_multi_file_programming.html) (~30 minutes, important for your homework)
