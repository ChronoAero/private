# Tutorial 0: Basic C (Self-Learned)

> Tutorial 0 (Programmers count from 0)

### Tutorial 0

- Content: basics of C
- Time: before the first tutorial of your session
- Venue: YouTube videos, self-learning
- Classworks: None (However, try the self-tests out)
- Homeworks: ZINC Programming Assignments
- Homework Deadline: `<some day in the future>`

### Tutorial 0 Targets

* Understand basic C syntax and do simple control flows
* Knows how to run your C program
* Understand how to submit ZINC assignments
* Introduce you to programming concepts if you are not familiar yet

## Tutorial 0 Links

The `not-so-important-so-please-scroll-quickly` Part:

* [01) Intro](01_intro.html)

Your first C program (~15 minutes)

* [02) Where to run your C code](02_where_to_write_code.html)
* [03) Hello World](03_hello_world)

Actual Materials

* [04) Variables and Input-Output](04_variable_io.html) (~30 
minutes)
  * Variables, assignment using `=`, `printf`, `scanf`
* [05) Operators](05_operators_html) (~30 minutes)
  * Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.), relational (`<`, `==`, etc.), compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`), increment and decrement (`++` and `--`)

You are suggested to read the following materials before tutorial 1 if you are not yet familiar to programming:

* [06) Rules and Extra Features](06_rules_and_extra_features.html) (~10 minutes, should be quick)
  * Rules on variable naming, booleans, standard integers, casting, and `const` keyword
* [07) Control Flow](07_control_flow.html) (~1 hour)
  * `if` statements, `switch` statemtent, `while` statement, `for` statement, scope


# Tutorial 1: Basic C

> Tutorial 1: Let's officially begin!

### Tutorial 1

- Content: basics of C
- Time: 
- Venue: `To be Announced`
- Classworks: `To be Announced`
- Homeworks: ZINC Programming Assignments
- Homework Deadline: `<some day in the future>`

### Tutorial 1 Targets

* Understand more concepts on C Programming and be able to implement more complicated programs
* Learn more convention and best practices in programming

## Tutorial 1 Links

We will start by emphasizing these materials:

* [06) Rules and Extra Features](06_rules_and_extra_features.html) (~10 minutes, should be quick)
  * Rules on variable naming, booleans, standard integers, casting, and `const` keyword
* [07) Control Flow](07_control_flow.html) (~1 hour)
  * `if` statements, `switch` statemtent, `while` statement, `for` statement, scope

Materials to introduce in Tutorial 1:

* [08) Array and String](08_array_string.html) (~30 minutes)
  * arrays, string (array of `char`), and the library `string.h`
* [09) Struct](09_struct.html) (~15 minutes)
* [10) Functions](10_functions.html) (~20 minutes)

We will discuss a bit of these materials, however you are expected to explore these yourself:

* [11) Recursion](11_recursion.html) (~40 minutes, we might not cover too much of it in class, but the concept is quite tricky, it is left for you to self learn in detail)
* [12) Multi File Programming](12_multi_file_programming.html) (~30 minutes, important for your homework)
